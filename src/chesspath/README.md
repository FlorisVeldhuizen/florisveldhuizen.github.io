Prince Chazz, firstborn son of the White King, is a valuable piece, moving in the same pattern a queen can. 
However, there is no prince in the established hierarchy, upsetting him. 
Chazz has a strong believe that proving himself worthy of battle will earn him a solid spot on the battlements. 
The player follows Chazz in his battles, finding his way deeper in the dungeons of his homeland. 
During his adventures Chazz meets new characters, 
assisting him in battle and giving the player more feedback about the past of Chazz. 
The firstborn daughter of the Black King eventually meets Chazz, both wondering why the ongoing battle never ends.
